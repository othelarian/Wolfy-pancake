sacred pancake is ready
sea god's bouquets fall from the sky
heads fall
corpses start singing
monsters pounce from the mist
the Chosen One roams the land
flames halos swords
the king is dying
love is reborn
death of thousands
the queen reaches her goal
the door is closing
snow falls
the spirit destroys the heretics
the prince returns
the heir is revealed
