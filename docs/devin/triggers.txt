When the monster under the mountain wakes up
When the sun disapears below the serpent cloud
When in the morning the midnight frogs sing
If the moon become lilas
When she give birth to the nine fingers child
When the cat barks and the dog hiss
While a fowl lay an egg
When the end is near
If the winds stop blowing for a month
When the water become red
When the book is torn
When the wood become stone
On the birth of the seventh daugther of a seventh daughter
On the whistle of the dead for the dusk
When the darkness meet noon sun
When the blood covers the moon
